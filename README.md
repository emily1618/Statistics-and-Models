### Creating Delicious Treats with Plot3d


- Test with mutiple dataset and use ```plot3d()``` to  build the dessert
- Use covariance matrix ```diag()``` in the context of linear algebra in generating data.
- Use MASS package ```mvnorm()``` to generate multivariate normal distribution points to form the "cloud".

### Regression Models and All The Goodies

- Examine the predictor and response variables by building a linear regression model using ```lm()``` and ```plot()``` .
- Check influential and leverage points with ```rstandard()```, ```lm.influence()```, and ```cook.distance()```.
- Build a standard deviation table using dplyr and Scale-Location model to check for variance changes.
- Transform the data to further improve the model and build a prediction table using ```predict.lm()```.
- Explain the results in ```confint()```, ```summary()```, ```anova()``` and diagnostic plots.
