### Creating Delicious Treats with Plot3d


- Test with mutiple dataset and use ```plot3d()``` to  build the dessert
- Use covariance matrix ```diag()``` in the context of linear algebra in generating data.
- Use MASS package ```mvnorm()``` to generate multivariate normal distribution points to form the "cloud".

### Improve Linear Regression Model and Identify Leverage Points

- Examine the independent and dependent variables by building a linear regression model using  ```lm()```
- Check influential and leverage points with ```cook.distance``` 
- Adding quadratic terms and remove outliers to improve the model.
- Build a standard deviation table using dplyr and Scale-Location model to check for variance changes.
- Transform the data to further improve the model and build a prediction table using ```predict.lm```
