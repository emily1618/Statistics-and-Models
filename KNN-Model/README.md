### Introduction:
Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing technologies enable deep insights
into cellular development, gene regulation, and phenotypic diversity by
measuring gene expression for thousands of cells in a single experiment. This
results in high-throughput datasets and requires the development of new types of
computational approaches to extract the useful and valuable underlying biological
information of individual cells in heterogeneous biological populations. This will begin with a K-NN and later use a more advance deep learning
method to identify the predictor variable.
